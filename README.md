# Unexpected Challenged JavaScript
This is a compilation of weird and bizzare JavaScript challenges.

![Main image](resources/main.jpg)

Contains different problems which require understanding of the nature of JavaScript language and sometimes thinking outside the box. Please **do not use** this at technical interviews, because it has a good chance to break a fine candidate. This is absolutly useless stuff in real life of your JavaScript applications and exists just for fun and trolling.
