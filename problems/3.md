# Snowing day
You have an array of string usernames. You should write a program that outputs a message using pattern `happy new year, ${username}!` for each user. But you have only letters which are presented in string *Snowing day*.

**Tip:** You have only 9 letters: *S, n, o, w, i, g, d, a, y*. Without the restriction the code may be like that:
```javascript
function happy(users) {
    for (let i = 0; i !== users.length; i += 1) {
        console.log(`happy new year, ${users[i]}!`);
    }
}


let users = ['John', 'Jack', 'James'];
happy(users);

// happy new year, John!
// happy new year, Jack!
// happy new year, James!
```
