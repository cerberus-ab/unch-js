# Done by Ones
Expected that the code fetches the requests and outputs their responses one by one and then outputs "done". But something is wrong: fix it.
```javascript
;(function() {
  let iter = {
    [Symbol.iterator]: function* iterf() {
      let fs = ['/1', '/2', '/3'];
      for (const req in fs) {
        yield fetch(req);
      }
    }
  };
  for (const res of iter) {
    console.log(res);
  }
  console.log('done');
})();
```

**Tip:** There are two problems with iterations. Make sure you have the next sequence of events:
```code
GET /1
> Response /1
GET /2
> Response /2
GET /3
> Response /3
> done
```
