# Broken Pipe
You have the next pipeline:
```javascript
console.log('The result is ' + [...Array(5)]
  .method((a, b) => [1 + b])
  .method((a, b) => Array.from(a))
  .method((a, b) => [...Array(a)])
  .method((a, b) => [a.length])
  .method((a, b) => [1 + a])
  .method((a, b) => a && b)
  .method((a, b) => a += b)
);
```

This pipeline should print into console "The result is 15". Replace all *methods* with the next operations: [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) (3), [flatMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flatMap) (3), [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) (2), [reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) (1). So one of them is excess.

**Tip:** This pipeline is not what it seems.
