# Look Complex
The input is an URL-query string which contains complex numbers in parameter **complex** by pattern **a + bi**. The real (a) and the imaginary (b) parts of the numbers are integers. There is an regular expression for matching the numbers from the string. But mysteriously 3 or 4 characters have been lost. Complete the expression:
```javascript
"?complex=2+3i&complex=-i&complex=-10&complex=abc&complex=i+1&nocomplex=-1+i&complex=5-7"
.match(/(?=[\&]complex=)-?(?:\d*i|\d(?:[-+]\d*i)?)(?=&|$)/);
```

Should return the next array:
```json
["2+3i", "-i", "-10"]
```

Remember, those cases are just smoke examples.
