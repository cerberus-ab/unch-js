# Countdown Expression
The origin expression returns 3.

The expression returns 2:
```javascript
+(_ => [,~1,])().length
```

The expression returns 1:
```javascript
+(_ => [,,~1]()).length
+((_ => [,,~1])).length
+(_ => ([,,~1])).length
```

The expression returns 0 with two rearranges:
```javascript
~1+(_ => [,,])().length
```

Extra solutions to return 0 with two rearranges:
```javascript
+(_ => [,~.1])(),length
+(_ => [,~1.])(),length
```

> It works if the environment is a browser. Then first part (before comma operator) is skipped and window.length returns the amount of frames in the document. If the document is empty it might return 0.
