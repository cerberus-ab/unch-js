# Look Complex
The completed expression is:
```javascript
/(?<=[\?&]complex=)-?(?:\d*i|\d+(?:[-+]\d*i)?)(?=&|$)/g
```

So,  

*1.* You need the `g` flag in the end because it is considered to return all matches without capturing groups. In other words it is necessary to return the needle array as a result.

*2.* Next your should fix the positive lookbehind (from ES2018) in the first assertion as `?<=` instead of `?=` to check the parameter before the pattern of complex number.

*3.* All parameters in an URL-query string are split by `&`. But the first one is separated from URL-path by `?`. This character should be listed in the bracket expression too, so `[\?&]`. By the way, you do not have to escape that characters in the case and `\` is redundant here.

*4.* Finally, it is possible to have a complex number which has the real part with 2 or more digits (for the instance, **10+2i**). But those cases are not covered by the pattern because of single digit `\d` before the imaginary part. So, `\d+` fixes the problem. It can not be `*` here because in that case an empty string will be wrongly considered as a correct complex number.

Also the non-capturing groups (`?:`) are redundant in the expression with the `g` flag. It is presented only in order to confuse.
